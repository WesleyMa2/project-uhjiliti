## Description
A Project management app that combines a ticketing system, video chat, messaging, and other features commonly used in development projects (scrum poker, project board, etc).

## [API Documentation](/server/docs/README.md)

## Features:
### To be completed by Beta version:
- Projects setup and user invites
    - allow users to make new project, invite other users to the project by email
    - tickets will be associated with projects
- Ticket management system 
    - like trello board
    - an item in a list can be classified as a story, task or bug
    - items can refer to other items (eg. stories can refer to 3 tasks)
- Video chat 
    - Any user can create a team meeting which calls everyone in project (multi video call)
    - Supports video and audio, using WebRTC and p2p connections. 
- Messaging with multiple channels
    - Each project will have multiple text channels where users can coordinate work or plan new features for the project. The text channels will support embedded code, images and emoticons. 
    
### To be completed by Final version:
- Tickets have deadlines
    - Tickets can have target completion dates.
    - If ticket isn't complete by the deadline, it becomes overdue.
    - Overdue tickets change in appearance and appear at the top of the chart.  
- Scrum poker (Not Completed)
    - everyone is given a set time to choose a number
